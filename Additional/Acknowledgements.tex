First and foremost, I'd want to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Ph.D. Jhovanny Mej√≠a, for his patience during the whole process of data analysis and preparation of this manuscript. He's been incredibly helpful and considerate.

I'd also like to express my gratitude to my mother, Rubiela, who has always been there for me, even at my darkest moments, as well to my friends, Esteban and Emmanuel, and especially to Yomara, who is no longer with us but was tremendously supportive.

Finally, I must express my gratitude for the opportunity to study at the Universidad de Antioquia; it has been the most enriching experience of my life, and I would not have been able to complete my bachelor's degree without the university's support in a variety of ways and the excellent teachers I met during my studies.
