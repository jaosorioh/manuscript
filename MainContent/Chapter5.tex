\section{Total efficiency}

The acceptance $\alpha$ for the $B^0_s$ meson can be studied using the MC simulation data. $\alpha$ is defined as the ratio of the number of $B^0_s$ mesons that meet the filter criteria for the kaons and muons candidates, table \ref{table:sel_criteria}, to the total number of $B^0_s$ mesons created in the MC simulation,

\begin{equation}
\alpha(p_T, |y|) = \frac{N(B^0_s; \ p_T, |y| ; \ \mathrm{filter \ criteria})}{N(B^0_s; \ p_T, |y| )}
\end{equation}

This value depends on the desired region for both $p_T$ and $|y|$. Because this manuscript takes into account several bins for these variables, a separate acceptance is obtained for each bin, as well as a total acceptance for the entire region. 

The reconstruction efficiency, $\epsilon$, is defined as the ratio of the number of $B^0_s$ mesons that meet all of the selection criteria from table \ref{table:sel_criteria} to the number of $B^0_s$ mesons that meet the filter criteria for kaons and muons candidates (the numerator of acceptance),

\begin{equation}
	\epsilon(p_T, |y|) = \frac{N(B^0_s; \ p_T, |y| ; \ \mathrm{full \ selection \ criteria})}{N(B^0_s; \ p_T, |y| ; \ \mathrm{filter \ criteria})}
\end{equation}

The overall efficiency $\alpha \cdot \epsilon$, is the fraction of the generated $B^0_s$ mesons that actually correspond to the required candidates for investigation, that is, the mesons that decay through the channel studied in this work,

\begin{equation}
	\alpha \cdot \epsilon = \frac{N(B^0_s; \ p_T, |y| ; \ \mathrm{full \ selection \ criteria})}{N(B^0_s; \ p_T, |y|)}
\end{equation}


\section{Differential cross-section}

In particle physics, the term cross-section is used to express the probability of a given event occurring \cite{thomson2013modern}. More specifically, the probability that two colliding particles would interact and generate a certain event, such as the production of a specific particle \cite{pivarski2013}. The cross-section will be used in this thesis to refer to the probability of producing a $B^0_s$ meson during p-Pb collisions that decays in the manner described in \ref{subsec:channel}.

It is sometimes desirable to investigate how a specific kinematic quantity is distributed in respect to the cross-section \cite{thomson2013modern}. This could be valuable in gaining a better understanding of the interaction. For this, the differential cross-section might be used. The differential cross-section for the transverse momentum, $p_T$, is calculated as follows \cite{abe1995measurement}: 

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:cs}
\frac{d \sigma(B_0^s)}{dp_T} = \frac{N_s}{2 \Delta p_T \cdot \alpha \cdot \epsilon \cdot BR \cdot \mathcal{L}}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta p_T$ is the width of the $p_T$ region, $\alpha \cdot \epsilon$ is the total efficiency, BR is the branching ratio of the total decay chain, eq. \ref{eq:br}, and $\mathcal{L} = 179.7$ nb$^{-1}$  is the total integrated luminosity. Due of the quick transitions between particle and antiparticle indicated in \ref{sec:b0s}, both $B^0_s$ and $\bar{B^0_s}$ are formed in the collision, but only $B^0_s$ is considered, for this reason, the factor $\frac{1}{2}$ is included in the equation above.

\section{Uncertainty for the cross-section}

In the estimation of the uncertainty of the differential cross-section, several sources of statistical and systematic uncertainties are to be considered. By using eq. \ref{totaluncertainty} in eq. \ref{eq:cs}, the total statistical uncertainty can be obtained:

\begin{equation}
	\delta \left(\frac{d\sigma(B_0^s)}{dp_T} \right)_{stat} 
 =\frac{d \sigma(B_0^s)}{dp_T}\left| \frac{\delta N_s}{N_s}\right|
 \end{equation}

In this situation, only the number of signal events $N_s$ is taken into account. An explanation on how to determine the sources of systematic uncertainties is provided below. 

\subsection{Fit model}

The influence of the signal and background PDFs is analyzed independently to establish the systematic uncertainty deriving from the chosen invariant mass PDF. To accomplish this, one of the PDFs is maintained unmodified, while the other is replaced with aÂ PDF that is also suitable for the data.

As described in section \ref{mlmethod}, the signal PDF has fixed parameters, therefore, a PDF with free parameters is used. Once the fit is completed, a second value for the number of signal events is obtained $N_s'$, and the difference between the original value $N_s$ and $N_s'$ is considered the source of systematic uncertainty in the signal model, $\sigma_{sig}$.

The systematic uncertainties from the background are calculated in a similar fashion. The background PDF is replaced by a PDF consisting of a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind:

\begin{equation}
	B_{PDF}^{'}(M_i) = \sum_{i=0}^{N} c_i T_i(M_i) 
\end{equation}

with \cite{mason2002chebyshev} $T_i(M_i) = \cos(iM_i)$ and $c_i$ the coefficients. The \verb|ROOTFIT| library assumes that for $T_0 = 1$, the coefficient is simply $c_i = 1$ \cite{chebyshev}. Using this model, a second value $N_b'$ for the number of background events is obtained and the systematic uncertainty from the background, $\sigma_{bkg}$, is derived from difference between $N_b$ and $N_b'$.
\subsection{Efficiency}

\subsubsection{MC size}
The uncertainties of the ratios defined for the acceptance and efficiency, $\delta \alpha$ and $\delta \epsilon$ are statistical. However, due to the finite size of the number of Monte Carlo samples used for reconstruction, they turn into systematic uncertainties when considering the differential cross-section. For practical purposes, the uncertainty of the total efficiency $\delta(\alpha \cdot \epsilon)$ is used instead of the individual uncertainties.
\subsubsection{Track}

The uncertainty in the efficiency of reconstruction of the tracks ($K^{+}K^{-}$) is considered a systematic uncertainty. In this paper, we will use the value reported by \cite{cms2018tracking} as the track efficiency uncertainty: $2.4\%$.
